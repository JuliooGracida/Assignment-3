**How to Run the Code**

This code was written using replit.com  
You can copy and paste the URL below to run it in your web browser.  
https://replit.com/@SimplyJuly/Assignment-3#main.cpp  
If you do so, you'll see a menu that allows you to choose which function to test. 

You can also download the files from Github to run it in your preferred IDE. 

Only these 4 files are needed:  
**main.cpp** (user friendly menu that calls functions)  
**dialogue.h** (unrelated to assignment requirements but prints out dialogue and provides formatting. It looks pretty because of this file!)  
**functions.h** (header file with function declarations - It is also describes the before and after of each function use)  
**functions.cpp** (function definitons)
